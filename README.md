# IAPWS95
IAPWS95 is the pure water equation of state (EoS), detailed in Wagner and Pru√ü (2002). 
This EoS is valid for fluid (vapor, liquid, and supercritical) phases of water, from the melting line and up to 1273 K and 1 GPa.

This program takes as input the temperature (in K) and pressure (in Pa) of pure water and provides several thermodynamic properties of pure water fluid phases.

## Usage:
To use this EoS, import it in a python script and then initiate a DataPoint object:

```python
import IAPWS95

my_point = IAPWS95.DataPoint(my_temperature, my_pressure)
```
This call will generate an object containing the following list of properties:

```python
my_point.T # my_temperature, provided as input
my_point.p # my_pressure, provided as input
my_point.rho # density, mol.m^{-3}
my_point.Cp  # heat capacity at constant pressure J.mol^{-1}.K^{-1}
my_point.s  # entropy J.mol^{-1}.K^{-1}
my_point.u  # internal energy J.mol^{-1}
my_point.dsdp  # the derivative of entropy with pressure at constant volume J.mol^{-1}.K^{-1}.Pa^{-1}
```
On the saturation vapor pressure line, this program returns the properties of the vapor phase.

The call of the IAPWS95 DataPoint object is further illustrated in the test_EOS.py routine, that also contains a benchmark used to test the validity of the EoS
